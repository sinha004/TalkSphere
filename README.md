Here‚Äôs a **System Design Document** for your **Real-time Chat Application Frontend**, including setup instructions, dependencies, and the rationale behind them.

---

# **System Design Document**

## 1. **Introduction**

This document outlines the design, technology stack, and setup for the **frontend** of the Real-time Chat Application. The frontend is built using modern web technologies like **Next.js**, **Framer Motion**, and **ShadCN UI**, and provides users with a smooth and intuitive interface for messaging, group chats, video calls, and AI-powered therapy assistance.

---

## 2. **System Architecture**

### 2.1 **Frontend Architecture**

The frontend is a **React-based** Single Page Application (SPA) powered by **Next.js**. It communicates with the backend via REST APIs and WebSocket connections, allowing real-time features like messaging and notifications. It also integrates with third-party services like **ZEGOCLOUD** for video calls and **TheraWin AI ChatBot** for therapy assistance.

### 2.2 **Component Diagram**
```
[ Client (Browser) ]
       |
       |     RESTful API (HTTP) + WebSocket (Socket.io)
       |
[ Frontend (Next.js) ] ------ [ Backend (Node.js + Express) ]
       |                      |
[ UI Components (Framer Motion, ShadCN UI) ]   [ MongoDB (Data Storage) ]
```

## 3. **Technology Stack**

### 3.1 **Next.js**
The primary framework used for building the frontend. Next.js is a **React-based framework** that supports server-side rendering and static site generation, enhancing both performance and SEO. It was chosen for its developer-friendly environment and scalability.

### 3.2 **Framer Motion**
Framer Motion is used to implement animations in the application. Its seamless integration with React provides a **smooth user experience** by enhancing interactions and transitions across the user interface.

### 3.3 **ShadCN UI**
ShadCN UI was chosen for building **modern, responsive UI components**. It offers pre-built yet highly customizable components, ensuring the frontend has a clean, professional look while maintaining flexibility in design.

### 3.4 **Socket.io**
Socket.io enables **real-time communication** between the client and the backend. It provides bi-directional communication, allowing instant message exchanges without needing page refreshes.

### 3.5 **ZEGOCLOUD**
ZEGOCLOUD is integrated into the application to support **video calls**. This service was chosen for its **reliable performance and ease of integration** with existing systems, making video calling accessible with minimal development effort.

### 3.6 **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
JWT is used for **authentication**. It ensures that users can securely log in and stay authenticated throughout their sessions. JWT was chosen for its ability to manage stateless authentication, reducing server overhead.

---

## 4. **Dependencies and Libraries**

- **Next.js**: React framework with support for server-side rendering.
- **Framer Motion**: A React animation library used for fluid transitions and animations.
- **ShadCN UI**: A customizable UI component library for building modern, responsive interfaces.
- **Socket.io**: For real-time communication via WebSocket.
- **ZEGOCLOUD**: For enabling video calls.
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)**: For token-based user authentication.

### Installation of Dependencies:
Once the repository is cloned, you can install all dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required libraries from the `package.json` file.

---

## 5. **Workflows and Components**

### 5.1 **User Authentication Flow**
1. **Sign-up/Login**: Users register or log in through the frontend.
2. **JWT Token Issued**: Upon successful login, the backend issues a JWT token that is stored locally on the client.
3. **Authenticated Requests**: This token is sent with each request, allowing the backend to authenticate the user without requiring session storage.

### 5.2 **Real-Time Messaging Workflow**
1. **Client establishes WebSocket connection** with the backend using **Socket.io**.
2. **Real-time updates**: Messages are sent and received instantly via WebSocket, allowing for seamless communication.

### 5.3 **Video Calling Workflow**
1. Users initiate a video call, and the frontend **integrates with ZEGOCLOUD** to create a video session.
2. The session is established via an API call to ZEGOCLOUD, enabling users to communicate via video seamlessly.

---

## 6. **How to Set Up and Run the Frontend**

### 6.1 **Prerequisites**
- **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed. You can download it from [Node.js Official Site](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Netlify CLI** (optional): If you want to deploy locally using Netlify for easier management.

### 6.2 **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anishiit/chat-frontend.git
```

### 6.3 **Install Dependencies**
Navigate to the cloned project directory:
```bash
cd chat-frontend
npm install
```

### 6.4 **Environment Setup**
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ZEGOCLOUD_APP_ID=your-zegocloud-app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_ZEGOCLOUD_APP_SECRET=your-zegocloud-app-secret
```

### 6.5 **Run the Frontend**
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will run on `http://localhost:3000`.
